The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Whitelist the ones you trust while deleting the rest. Support for Container Tabs.","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":10401,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/mrkennyd/5?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.6193,"reviewCount":529,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1598254129000},{"id":"{74145f27-f039-47ce-a470-a662b129930a}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-32.png?modified=b06fa7ed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-64.png?modified=b06fa7ed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/839/839767-128.png?modified=b06fa7ed"},"name":"ClearURLs","version":"1.19.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3612592/clearurls-1.19.0-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://clearurls.xyz/","supportURL":"http://wiki.clearurls.xyz","description":"Removes tracking elements from URLs","fullDescription":"This extension will automatically remove tracking elements from URLs to help protect your privacy when browse through the Internet.\n\nMany websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale) to mark your online activity. All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy. We do not—and will never—collect any of your usage data.\n\nWhat do I do if I have trouble?\nVisit our GitLab page or check out our wiki.\n\nWrite us...\nIf have any suggestions or complaints, please contact us on GitLab.\n\nPermissions\nReasoning for needed permissions can be found under here.\n\nContributors\n\n    Kevin Röbert (creator/developer)\n    Yi-Ping Huang (translator)\n    rayman89 (translator)\n    Ramon Santilli (translator)\n    Lucifer (translator)\n    Shitennouji (translator)\n    K3A (contributor)\n    perdolka (contributor)\n    Nameless (contributor)\n    a-polivanchuk (translator)\n    hydrargyrum (translator)\n    alekksander (translator)\n    Zoltan Toldy (translator)\n    tartpvule (contributor)\n    Giovanni (translator)\n    U.

In this version, your requests are sent to the Floodgap Public Gopher Proxy, which converts the Gopher menu and documents to HTML and HTTP. Future versions will allow a choice of proxy, and eventually restore direct connections to Gopher servers when the API is finally available from Mozilla. Thanks for your patience and indulgence while we wait for WebExtensions to become more useful and complete for the next generation of Firefox addons.\n\nNEW: If you would like to try an experimental Gopher add-on allowing direct connection to Gopher servers using a native component, try our experimental companion add-on, OverbiteNX. OverbiteNX requires a separate open-source component be installed on your computer. OverbiteWX will only use supported WebExtensions APIs.\n\nTo set up OverbiteWX:\n\n    Install the addon.\n    Enter any Gopher URL or click any Gopher link starting with gopher://\n    Firefox will pop up a window saying you must select an application to view that link. OverbiteWX will be in the list. Select it, check the box to remember this choice if you desire (strongly recommended, or you will get this window every time), and click Open Link.\n    The Gopher site you have selected will be rendered by the Floodgap Gopher proxy.\n\n\nYou can always choose another Gopher handler from Preferences, Applications. If you uninstall OverbiteWX, you will be asked to choose a new Gopher handler on the next Gopher site you visit.\n\nThanks for using OverbiteWX!","weeklyDownloads":80,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"The Overbite Project","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/user/1605919/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.9091,"reviewCount":5,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/overbitewx/reviews/","updateDate":1516900811000},{"id":"{96ef5869-e3ba-4d21-b86e-21b163096400}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2596/2596225-32.png?modified=26a76a47","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2596/2596225-64.png?modified=26a76a47","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2596/2596225-128.png?modified=26a76a47"},"name":"Font Fingerprint Defender","version":"0.1.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3563877/font_fingerprint_defender-0.1.2-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://mybrowseraddon.com/font-defender.html","supportURL":"https://mybrowseraddon.com/font-defender.html","description":"Defending against Font fingerprinting by reporting a fake value.","fullDescription":"Font Fingerprint Defender is a lite addon that let you easily hide your real font fingerprint by reporting a random fake value and protect your privacy.\n\nThis addon does NOT block the fingerprint, instead, it simply adds a small noise to the actual fingerprint and \"renews\" it every time you visit a website or reload a page.

# Insertdead's Dotfiles
Various configs stolen from various people.

I plan on making some more documentation for my dotfiles sometime in the future.

## Requirements
* Tmux Plugin Manager
* Zshell (zsh) - zinit is required.
* Fish shell - Some aliases may not work depending on the programs or distro you have installed.
	* [Starship](https://starhip.rs)

### Neovim (0.5.0 or higher)
* [paq-nvim](https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim) is required
* __LSP__ (**L**anguage **S**erver **P**rotocol) servers for whatever languages you use most are recommended.

## Credits
* [DistroTube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1)
* [\@jonaburg](https://github.com/jonaburg)
* [\@lukesmithxyz](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz)
* the `init.lua` (and the other lua files required in the `init.lua`) for neovim was heavily inspired by [\@ojroques](https://github.com/ojroques)'s `init.lua`
* And all the developpers who made the default configs in my dotfiles

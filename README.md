# Insertdead's Dotfiles
Various configs stolen from various people.

I plan on making some more documentation for my dotfiles sometime in the future.

## Requirements
* Zshell (zsh) - zinit & starship are required.
* Fish shell - Some aliases may not work depending on the programs or distro you have installed.
	* [Starship](https://starhip.rs)

### Neovim (0.5.0 or higher)
* [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) is required

## Credits
* [DistroTube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1)
* [\@jonaburg](https://github.com/jonaburg)
* [\@lukesmithxyz](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz)
* [\@siduck76](https://github.com/siduck76) for the NvChad based nvim config
* And all the developpers who made the default configs in my dotfiles
